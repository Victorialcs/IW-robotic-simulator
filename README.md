The file above are the ones I created.
However, my files use functions and objects that are in the bullet3 (PyBullet) library.
Here is a link to the library: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3

The demo of the project is under the "screen recording" file. If it is too big to open, please download the raw file to your computer to view.
